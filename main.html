<p class=bar>Mission Statement</p>
<p>The goal of the Equinox project is to be a first class OSGi
  community and foster the vision of Eclipse as a landscape of bundles. As part
  of this, it is responsible for developing and delivering the OSGi framework
  implementation
  used for all
  of
  Eclipse. In addition. the
  project
  is open to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of all aspects of the OSGi specification (including the MEG
  and VEG work) </li>
  <li>    Investigation and research related to future versions of OSGi specifications
  and related runtime issues </li>
  <li>Development of non-standard infrastructure deemed to be essential
  to the running and management of OSGi-based systems </li>
  <li>Implementation of key framework services
      and extensions needed for running Eclipse (e.g., the Eclipse Adaptor, Extension
  registry) and deemed generally useful to people using OSGi.  </li>
</ul>
  As a peer of the Platform, JDT and PDE projects, the Equinox OSGi code is
  managed by the Eclipse PMC and ships with the Eclipse project
major releases. The various other bundles developed here may ship independently
  and on different schedules. 
  <p>Did you come here expecting to find the Equinox Technology project? It has
  been transitioned. See the <a href="documents/transition.html">transition documentation</a> for more details.</p>

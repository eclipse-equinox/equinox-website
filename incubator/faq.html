      <p><b>What is the relationship between Equinox and the Eclipse platform project?</b><br>
        The Eclipse platform project is the main development effort for Eclipse. 
        Equinox is a forum for exploring approaches and technologies which could 
        be used by the platform to increase its runtime flexibility.</p>

      <p><b>What does Equinox deliver/ship?</b><br>
        The Equinox project is designed to provide input to the Eclipse platform 
        effort. As such, it delivers well-thoughtout prototype solutions to particular 
        issues. While it may offer interrim downloads of its work in progress, 
        Equinox will not support ongoing, stand-alone function which has not/will 
        not be rolled into the platform proper.</p>

    <td> 
      <p><b>Why isn't this work being done in the Eclipse platform project?</b><br>
        There are two main reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Equinox is exploration. Some of the work will bear fruit and some 
          will not. Some of the work is long term and may not make it into the 
          next release.</li>
        <li>On the purely pragmatic side, having a separate project provides the 
          infrastructure and support for a safe and productive workspace.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>

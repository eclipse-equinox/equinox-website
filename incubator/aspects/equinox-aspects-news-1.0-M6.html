    <h1>Equinox Aspects 1.0 M6 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
    
    <p>
      During the M6 timeframe we had a lot of very fruitful discussions with the AJDT team
      to make Equinox Aspects easier to use and to have more fine-grained control of the
      actual weaving. The goal of M7 will be to implement those changes.

          Triggered by Andy Clement and Andrew Eisenberg we discussed some major
          improvements how to control the weaving of aspects within the Equinox
          Aspects setting. The discussions and basic design decisions are made and
          will be implemented during the next milestone timeframe. Please follow

        <td width="70%" valign="top">
          Because of some major improvements within the loadtime weaving implementation
          of AspectJ we now have a version dependency on at least version 1.6.2 of the
          AspectJ weaver package imports. This avoids confusion if you have multiple versions
          of those packages installed (which is the case if you have AJDT and SpringIDE
          installed together, for example). If you have the latest AJDT versions in use,
          you should have no problems. If you definitely need Equinox Aspects to work with
          older AspectJ weaver versions, please let us know.

        </td>
        <td width="70%" valign="top">
          We got some bug reports regarding the standard cache implementation. That seemed to
          cause problems with the file handling in some (mostly OS-dependent) situations.
          The major problem was that those problems caused the complete system to hang. We
          now reimplemented the cache writing for the standard caching service to an asynchronous
          mode. Woven class bytecodes are put into a bounded concurrent queue and a different
          thread takes care to write those bytes to the appropriate directory. This makes the
          cache handing even faster since the thread that caused the weaving is no longer used
          to write the bytes to the cache and can continue right away.

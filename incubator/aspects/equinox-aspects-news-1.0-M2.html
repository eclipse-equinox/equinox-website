    <h1>Equinox Aspects 1.0 M2 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
    
    <p>
      The Equinox Aspects incubator project is now aligning itself with the general development
      process of the other Eclipse projects and is moving towards graduation. Therefore we are
      starting this effort by producing a number of milestone builds over the next weeks and months
      and share them with you - including a new and noteworthy announcement.
    </p>

          We haven't got as much done as we wished for this milestone build. Nevertheless we
          fixed two important bugs that were of particular interest for dynamics of aspect bundles
          and starting the system without cleaning the configuration. Both now works better
          than in M1.
          <ul>
            <li>fixed: supplementer mechanism broken without clean configuration (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=243681">bug 243681</a>)</li>
            <li>fixed: aspect bundle update is broken (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=244410">bug 244410</a>)</li>
          </ul>
          We are pretty sure that you will see more stuff being done for M3. So stay tuned.

    <h1>Equinox Aspects 1.0 M7 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
    
    <p>
      The major work that was done in the M7 milestone of Equinox Aspects focussed on more
      fine grained control of the weaving process. We discussed these enhancements a lot with
      the AJDT team and have now a first version of this available. Please give feedback on
      this improvement and tell us, what you observe.

          The general design of Equinox Aspects allows you to use your
          own bytecode modifiers instead of AspectJ's aspect weaving together
          with the base Equinox Aspects infrastructure. To prove this we
          implemented (as an example) a weaving service that connects Equinox
          Aspects to the spring dynamic modules infrastructure to make all
          the spring load-time weavers (AspectJ, JPA, etc.) work within OSGi
          using Equinox Aspects.<br/>
          You can find more on this implementation in this blog entry:<br/>

        <td width="70%" valign="top">
          We implemented a number of additional options and mechanisms that allow
          you to control the weaving of aspects on a more fine-grained level. The
          major discussion of this took place in
          <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=255682">bug 255682</a>.<br/><br/>
          <b>What is new?</b><br/><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>the packages of aspects in aop.xml needs to be exported via
                the bundle manifest. If they are not, the aspect is no longer
                woven into other bundles.</li>
            <li>you don't need an aop.xml file anymore. Instead of list your
                aspects within this special file, you can add them as attribute
                to your export-package declaration in the manifest:<br/>
                <b>Export-Package: com.foo.bar;aspects="Tracing,Monitoring"</b><br/></li>
            <li>if you export an aspect, you can define a policy when this aspect
                should be woven into bundles that are depending on this package
                (via Import-Package or Require-Bundle):<br/>
                <b>Export-Package: com.foo.bar;aspect-policy:=opt-out;aspects="Tracing,Monitoring"</b><br/>
                In this "opt-out" case your aspects are woven into dependend bundles
                unless they explicitly prevent those aspects from being woven into them.<br/>
                If you use "opt-in" instead, these aspects are NOT woven unless the
                dependend bundle explicitly asks for them being woven.</li>
            <li>if you import a package (or require a bundle) that exports an aspect,
                you can define an "apply-aspects" directive to tell Equinox Aspects
                whether to weave the imported aspects into your bundle or not.<br/>
                <b>Import-Package: com.foo.bar;apply-aspects:=true</b><br/>
                This means the aspects that are exported from the bundle that satisfies
                this import should be woven into your bundle. If you define "false", then
                those aspects are not woven into your bundle.</li>
          </ul>
          
          More details on this can be found in the comments for
          <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=255682">bug #255682</a>,
          especially in <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=255682#c18">comment #18</a>
          and following.<br/>
          <br/>
          The supplementer mechanism is not touched by this. If you define aspects
          within a bundle via aop.xml or the manifest, export the package and supplement
          another bundle, those aspects are being woven into the supplemented bundle
          as always.<br/>
          <br/>
          The new mechanism should be completely backwards compatible. So if you run your
          aspect bundles as they are with the new build and observe any problems, please
          open a new issue in bugzilla.<br/>

        <td width="70%" valign="top">
          Equinox Aspects tries to avoid weaving a bundle whereas possible to avoid
          the weaving overhead. But there are situations where Equinox Aspects cannot
          decide on its own efficiently whether to weave a bundle or not. This is the
          case for bundles that contain @Aspect-style aspects, define them in aop.xml
          or via the manifest and where not compiled with AJDT (or AspectJ in general).
          In those situations Equinox Aspects needs to weave the bundle to "finish"
          the aspects in bytecode.<br/>
          Because Equinox Aspects cannot easily decide whether the aspects inside a
          bundle are finished or not, it always weaves the bundle with its own aspects
          in such cases. If you know that you compiled your aspect bundle with AJDT
          and therefore know that your aspects are finished, you can tell Equinox
          Aspects this in the manifest. Simply add:<br/><br/>
          <b>Eclipse-AspectBundle: finished</b><br/>

          We fixed a bug that prevented you from defining an aspect inside a fragment

          In the past the caching service denied to cache generated classes for some
          reasons, especially the problem of invalidating those cache items. Since the
          latest versions of Equinox Aspects deal with the cache invalidation using the
          OSGi bundle names, versions and update dates, we are now able to cache
          generated classes the same way we cache all other woven bytecode. This is
          implemented in this milestone build for the standard caching service.<br/>
          This was the last step towards getting zero-overhead startup performance
          for the cached scenario. :-)

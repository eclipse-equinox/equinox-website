<p>The following state diagram describes the various states plugins go through. 
  While these states can be attributed to a given plugin, some states are relative 
  to a given context. For example, a plugin may be enabled in one context and 
  disabled in another.</p>
<p>The red arrows indicate state transitions which are currently not possible 
  or require the platform to be shutdown and restarted.<img src="states.gif"/></p>
<p/> The events that triggers state changes can be partitioned into three sets 
  relative to the action and the processing done in response to the events. For 
  example, few plugins are interested in the "installation" or "configuration" 
  events. And, the reaction to a "deactivation" event is likely different than 
  the processing of an "unresolved" event. </p>
<p/>These event are typically triggered from different roles within the system. 
  For example, someone installing plugins causes install, configure, enable events 
  while system startup triggers resolution and system execution kicks off activation 
  events. </p>
The resulting partitions are: 
<ul>
  <li>Administration events: installed, uninstalled, configured, unconfigured</li>
  , enabled, disabled 
  <li>Registry events: resolved, unresolved</li>
  <li>Plugin events: actived, deactived</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Activated</b>: A plugin is in activated state when its startup() method 
    has been called and its shutdown() method has not been called. In 2.1 plugin 
    activation is triggered by the loading of a class from that plugin;</li>
  <li><b>Configuration</b>: A configuration is a collection of plugins which are 
    available to participate in plugin resolution and thus in forming the runtime 
    registry. </li>
  <li><b>Deactivated</b>: A plugin is in deactivated state if its shutdown() method 
    has been called (or the platform has been started) and its startup() method 
    has been subsequently called;</li>
  <li><b>Deactivation</b>: The process of changing a plugin state from activated 
    to deactivated;</li>
  <li><b>Disabled</b>: A plugin is in disabled state if it is installed but either 
    has been explicitly marked as disabled or has never been marked as enabled. 
    A disabled plugin does not participate in registry resolution. In 2.1 a plugin 
    can only be disabled at startup time.</li>
  <li><b>Disablement</b>: The act of changing a plugin state from enable to disable 
    at runtime. The disablement can only be done is the plugin is deactivated.</li>
  <li><b>Enabled</b>: A plugin is enabled if it has been is installed and has 
    been explicitly marked as enabled or has never been disabled.</li>
  <li><b>Installed</b>: A plugin is installed if it is physically present and 
    available for inclusion in a configuration.</li>
  <li><b>Resolved</b>: A plugin is resolved relative to a given configuration. 
    Resolved plugins are present in the runtime registry and their functionality 
    is available for use. In 2.1, plugins are resolved at startup if all its prerequisites 
    are available (for more details see <a href="currentPluginModel.html">the 
    current model page</a>);</li>
  <li><b>Unresolved</b>: A plugin is unresolved relative to a given configuration. 
    Unresolved plugins are not present in the runtime registry and their functionality 
    is not available for use.</li>

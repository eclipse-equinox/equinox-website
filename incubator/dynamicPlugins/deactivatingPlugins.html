<p> Deactivating plugins is the act of moving an activated plugin to deactivated 
  state. This does not remove it from the registry but runs the plugin's shutdown 
  lifecycle and returns the plugin to the same state as it was before it was activated 
  (i.e., when the platform started). All extensions and extension-points remain 
  in place in the registry. </p>
<p /> There are two reasons for deactivating a plugin: 
<ol>
  <li> regain some space by removing any structures required by the plugin and 
    recovering the space required for its classes. </li>
  <li> as a prelude to removing the plugin from the registry, also known as disablement (see <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p> Note that deactivating a plugin A which is required by plugin B does <b>not</b> 
  imply the B <b>must</b> be deactivated -- just as activating B does not imply 
  that A is activated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Deactivating a plugin does not itself require additional lifecycle events. 
  However, in general, other plugins have references to newly deactivated classes/objects 
  and the plugin being deactivated may not cleaned up after themselves. As a result, 
  some notification will be required to tell plugins to clean up their structures. 
</p>
<p>A plugin that is being shutdown should clean up its internals to limit the 
  number of external references it might have. However, it is often other plugins 
  have references to instances of the deactivated plugin's classes (e.g., the 
  resources plugin references supplied builder classes). This prevents those classes 
  and thus the plugin's classloader from being garbage collected. </p>
<p> One simple approach that can be implemented in the Eclipse runtime infrastructure 
  is to manage instances created via createExecutableExtension(). This is the 
  method used to create instances of classes provided via extensions to extension-points. 
  Since this code path goes through runtime code, the runtime could track instances 
  created and at report on plugins which retain references after a plugin is deactivated. 
  For more details, see <a href="classloadersAndInstances.html"> managing classloaders 
  and instances</a>. </p>
<p>Another approach simply broadcasts the deactivation notice and plugins hosting 
  extensions from the plugin being deactivated are responsible for the cleanup. 
</p>
<p>Pragmatically, both approaches should be supported.</p>

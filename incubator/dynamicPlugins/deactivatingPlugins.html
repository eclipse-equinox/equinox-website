<p> Deactivating plugins is the act of moving an activated plugin to deactivated 
  state. This does not remove it from the registry but runs the plugin's shutdown 
  lifecycle and returns the plugin to the same state as it was before it was activated 
  (i.e., when the platform started). All extensions and extension-points remain 
  in place in the registry. </p>
<p /> There are two reasons for deactivating a plugin: 
<ol>
  <li> regain some space by removing any structures required by the plugin and 
    recovering the space required for its classes. </li>
  <li> as a prelude to removing the plugin from the registry. </li>
</ol>
<p> Deactivating a plugin does not itself require additional lifecycle events. 
  However, in general, other plugins have references to newly deactivated classes/objects 
  and the plugin being deactivated may not cleaned up after themselves. As a result, 
  some notification will be required to tell plugins to clean up their structures. 
</p>
<p>Note that deactivating a plugin A which is required by plugin B does <b>not</b> 
  imply the B <b>must</b> be deactivated -- just as activating B does not imply 
  that A is activated.</p>

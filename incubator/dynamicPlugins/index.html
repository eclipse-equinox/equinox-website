The DynamicPlugin effort seeks to support a fully dynamic 
registry. The envisioned dynamic changes are the following:
loading or unloading a plugin, enable or disabling a loaded 
plugin, and allowing a plugin to dynamically add or remove 
extension points and extensions.
The current plugin registry in Eclipse is static, see details 
<a href="currentPluginModel.html">here</a>. 
</p><p>
It is static in the
sense that the registry has a static set of plugins, each 
declaring a static set of extension points and extensions.
Upon start up, the platform loads all the known plugins by
processing their manifest (plugin.xml). Through their manifest,
the entire set of prerequisites of plugins can be statically
built. All plugins that have their prerequisites satisfied,
required plugins and necessary extension points, are kept.
All the other plugins are removed from the registry. Once
the boot sequence is over, the registry is mark read-only
and cannot be changed further. Any change requires the 
platform to be stopped and restarted.
</p><p>
A first step toward a dynamic registry is allowing
plugin
<a href="deactivatingPlugins.html">deactivation</a>. 
Deactivating a plugin is mainly a 
performance optimization. It is the corollary to lazzy 
plugin activation. Plugins are lazzily activating to 
avoid wasting ressources for plugins whose functionality
are not used. However, once activated, plugins remain
activated even through they are no longer used. Deactivation
attempts to release resources associated to a plugin,
returning it to the state it had before it was activated.
</p><p>
Deactivation is a transparent optimization to Eclipse
users, as lazzy activation is. A dynamic registry goes 
beyong, offering Eclipse users the ability to install
new plugins or updates already installed ones. 
There are currently two proposals for adding dynamic
behavior to the plugin registry. One is based on delta 
as for changes in the resource plugin, the details are 
<a href="dynamicRegistry.html">here</a>.
The other approach is based on extending <i>Plugin class</i>,

There are several open questions on the table for 
both approaches. They are discussed

      Mission Statement</font></b></td>

  <tr> 
    <td> The goal of the Equinox project is to experiment with techniques for 
      broadening the range of Eclipse platform runtime configurations. For example, 
      the Eclipse plugin model is static; there is no discussion of practices 
      and tools for managing/reducing interplugin dependencies; service discovery 
      is not covered and the component distribution mechanism is non-standard. 
      <p>These issues do not severely impact the usefulness of Eclipse as a development 
        tool platform but they do affect the use of Eclipse in more constrained 
        environments (e.g., handheld devices, IT managed environments, mass-appeal 
        applications etc.). The Equinox project will investigate such issues and 
        develop approaches which are practical and applicable to the main Eclipse 
        code base. </p>

      <p>The Equinox work will focus on the following areas:</p>
      <dl> 
        <dt><b>Dynamic plug-ins</b></dt>
        <dd>Currently Eclipse uses a static plug-in model. When Eclipse is started 
          it discovers the set of installed plugins and builds a plugin registry. 
          This registry is then resolved and locked down. As a result, plugins 
          cannot be added, removed or updated without shutting down and restarting 
          Eclipse. In addition to being inconvenient for users managing their 
          installation, certain workflows and usecase do not allow for shutting 
          down and restarting the platform. Further, since plugins cannot be deactivated, 
          the memory footprint of a running Eclipse grows monotonically as the 
          user touches more and more function (i.e., activates more and more plugins). 
          Equinox will unlock the registry and enhance the plugin lifecycle to 
          allow dynamic plugin installation and removal/activation and deactivation.</dd>
        <dt><b>Component management</b></dt>
        <dd>Eclipse manages plugins, fragments and features using a mechanism 
          written specifically for Eclipse. While simple and reasonably powerful, 
          issues in the area of security/access and centralized configuration 
          management all need attention. Equinox will look at various mechanisms 
          and standards in this area (e.g., OSGi, JNLP, ...) and look at their 
          integration with Eclipse.</dd>
        <dt><b>Dependency management</b></dt>
        <dd>One of the key aspects of Eclipse is the factoring of function into 
          plugins. These plugins are then composed to form the technology base 
          for a given domain. The Eclipse team has done an excellent job of keeping 
          the dependencies between plugins relatively clean but still there problems 
          creating minimal installs in various scenarios. Equinox will look at 
          this fundamentally hard problem by exploring alternative factorings 
          of existing plug-ins (e.g., the UI plugins) as well as programming practices 
          and tools which support and foster the reduction and management of plugin 
          dependency chains.</dd>
        <dt><b>Services model</b></dt>
        <dd>The extensibility of Eclipse is based on plugins and their interconnection 
          via extension<b></b>s and extension points. While powerful, this model 
          can be constraining. For example, the UI plugins specify how people 
          contribute menu entries but not how/if someone can replace the implementation 
          of the UI itself. As a result, plugins are tied to the workbench UI 
          or must have alternate implementations for differing UI bases. Note 
          here that the UI domain is only one example, this problem surfaces in 
          other places. Equinox will investigate alternate models of linking plugins 
          together such as service discovery. It will not seek to replace the 
          extension/extension point mechanism but rather to complement it.</dd>

    <td> 
      <p>The Equinox project is primarily meant as an incubator for the Eclipse 
        platform project. While the platform team is under no obligation to accept 
        changes proposed by Equinox, the intention is that members of the platform 
        team be involved in Equinox and that the models, mechanisms and implementations 
        developed be immediately and obviously beneficial to the platform. To 
        that end, the Equinox project will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track changes in the platform through frequent resynchronization.</li>
        <li>Make available incremental and discrete changes so that the platform 
          team can smoothly integrate new technology as it is developed.</li>
        <li>Minimize API impact or propose migration paths where change cannot 
          be avoided.</li>
        <li>Produce largely working solutions.</li>
        <li>Seek to use existing technologies and standards wherever possible/relevant.</li>
        <li>Not support work items which have no hope of being integrated into 
          the Eclipse platform.</li>

    <td>Equinox is starting just as Eclipse 2.1 development is ending. As such, 
      the main focus will be on contributions to Eclipse 2.2 (4Q2003) with larger 
      or breaking changes being directed towards subsequent/major releases. The 
      expectation is that Equinox work be offered for integration into the platform 
      as soon as possible.</td>

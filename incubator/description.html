<p class=bar>Mission Statement</p>

<p>
The goal of the Equinox Incubator is to experiment with techniques for 
      broadening the range of Eclipse platform runtime configurations. For example, 
      the Eclipse plugin model is static; there is no discussion of practices 
      and tools for managing/reducing interplugin dependencies; service discovery 
      is not covered and the component distribution mechanism is non-standard. </p>
      <p>These issues do not severely impact the usefulness of Eclipse as a development 
        tool platform but they do affect the use of Eclipse in more constrained 
        environments (e.g., handheld devices, IT managed environments, mass-appeal 
        applications etc.). The Equinox project will investigate such issues and 
        develop approaches which are practical and applicable to the main Eclipse 
        code base. </p>

      <p>The Equinox project is primarily meant as an incubator for the Eclipse
         platform project. While the platform team is under no obligation to
        accept 
        changes proposed in Equinox, the intention is that members of the platform
         team be involved in Equinox and that the models, mechanisms and implementations
        
        developed be immediately and obviously beneficial to the platform. To
         that end, the Equinox project will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track changes in the platform through frequent resynchronization.</li>
        <li>Make available incremental and discrete changes so that the platform 
          team can smoothly integrate new technology as it is developed.</li>
        <li>Minimize API impact or propose migration paths where change cannot 
          be avoided.</li>
        <li>Produce largely working solutions.</li>
        <li>Seek to use existing technologies and standards wherever possible/relevant.</li>
        <li>Not support work items which have no hope of being integrated into 
          the Eclipse platform.</li>
      </ul>

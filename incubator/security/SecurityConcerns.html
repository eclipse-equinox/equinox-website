Tracking document for gathering notes on security concerns for the Rich
Client Platform theme of Eclipse 3.0.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Change history:<BR>
<BR>
2003/05/28 - MEM - started document<BR>
2003/05/29 - MEM - added development ramifications<BR>
2003/06/04 - MEM - added MEZ' concerns about priority of plugin
signatures<BR>
2003/06/11 - MEM - converted to HTML, did various edits and committed
to Equinox site<BR>
2003/06/12 - MEM - broke out signatures requirement to distinguish
signing/verifying a plugin contents versus code signatures uses for
runtime checks.<BR>
2003/06/20 - MEM - added note about plugin fragments, modifications
from feedback from Keith &amp; Chuck<BR style="font-weight: bold;">
<BR style="font-weight: bold;">
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Motives</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
The Rich Client Platform theme of the Eclipse 3.0 plan is motivated by
the desire to develop general purpose applications (i.e. non-IDE
applications) using the Eclipse platform. &nbsp;A key motivation is to
leverage the Eclipse plugin architecture so as to create modular,
pluggable applications that are easily extensible. &nbsp;With this
extensibility, however comes risks that must be ameliorated in order to
use the eclipse platform for develpment and deployment of
mission-critical applications. &nbsp;Even as an IDE, developers of
mission-critical code are exposed when using the Eclipse IDE should they
make use of rogue plugins.<BR>
<BR>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Where we are now:</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
Eclipse 2.1 platform does not provide any security features at this
point.&nbsp; There is no concept of a user (thus no user authentication
or access control) and all plugins execute as local code with no
security manager in effect.&nbsp; When talking to a feature server to
retrieve new plugins, no authentication takes place (is this true? Need
to verify).&nbsp; Jars can be examined for signatures but there is no
enforcement or sandboxing.&nbsp; The documentation on the Update Manager
does recommend to the user to not download plugins except from a trusted
source.&nbsp; :-)<BR>
<BR>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Vulnerabilities:</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
Multiple users of the same installation running in the same machine
account (i.e. kiosk applications) have free access to all of each
other's data.<BR>
Rogue user co-opting a machine account can use the platform to connect
to servers as configured for that user's workspace (for example, CVS
Repository connections are configured and persisted in the workspace).<BR>
Plugins are run with full access to the machine.&nbsp; Introduction of
a rogue plugin thus enables the following types of attacks:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>plugin reads critical data on machine</LI>
  <LI>plugin erases or modifies critical data on machine</LI>
  <LI>plugin opens connections to other server to either communicate
stolen data or to download malicious code or data</LI>
  <LI>plugin modifies other plugins to spread virus (simple virus
example: &nbsp;First examine other plugins to see which ones do not have
a Plugin subclass then simply insert new Plugin subclass into the target
plugin directory.)</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Where we want to be:</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
User - based security:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Need the optional concept of a 'user' within the RCP/Eclipse
world to support the secure shared use of a single Eclipse install from
within a single machine user account.&nbsp; I.E. the user would 'log in'
to the RCP application.&nbsp; Users would have independent
workspaces.&nbsp; This likely will require slight modification to
org.eclipse.resources in order to assert user authentication prior to
workspace association and to make use of (optional) encryption of local
user data. &nbsp; Should of course also support single-signon mode where
Eclipse User == Machine User.</LI>
  <LI>Need to optionally use JCE to encrypt data in workspaces.</LI>
  <LI>Need to authenticate users that access feature servers for
updates/new features.&nbsp; (is this already there?)</LI>
  <LI>Need to authenticate feature servers that users connect
with.&nbsp; (is this already there?)</LI>
  <LI>Need secure connection to feature server. (&nbsp; (is this
already there?)</LI>
  <LI>Provisioning&nbsp; - remote - need to be able to have
administrator do a 'server push' of plugin code out to a client in a
secure manner.</LI>
  <LI>Provisioning - need ability to establish a policy that determines
what features/plugins a user has installed.</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Code - based security<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Need to be able to verify signatures of&nbsp; plugins at load
time (not just download time) in order to authenticate source of the
plugin and the integrity of the plugin's files. This will likely require
manifest changes.</LI>
  <LI>Need to be able to verify signatures and sources of runtime code
contained by plugins. &nbsp;In other words, a jar file of code provided
by a plugin may have a different signature than the plugin as a whole.<BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Need to be able to protect plugins and local data from other,
malicious or otherwise destructive plugins.&nbsp; This will likely
require sandboxing.</LI>
  <LI>Want to be able to grant different levels of access to code from
different sources.&nbsp; How
fine-grained?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trade-off:
precision versus ease-of-use.</LI>
  <LI>Declarative model (plugin manifest requests permissions - ask
user at install time) versus implicit (only ask user if a security
exception is tripped).&nbsp;&nbsp; Have to catch the latter anyway, but
might make nicer UI to get as much of it out of the way early.</LI>
  <LI>Fragments - fragments currently run effectively 'merged' with the
plugin they are augmenting. &nbsp;But a fragment potentially comes from
a different source than the plugin. &nbsp;We need to make sure we run
code from fragments with the appropriate permissions.<BR>
  </LI>

<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Development ramifications of adding
security to the platform</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>Need to define format for applying signatures to plugins. Even in
the absence of enforcement, we need to define a standard as soon as
possible. &nbsp;This spec should be able to work whether the plugin is
run as a jar or a directory. &nbsp;Tthe issue here is that plugins are
not currently run from closed jar files for which a simple single
signature would suffice for verification.&nbsp; Signing just a the
'code' jars in a plugin also would not catch illicit resources contained
in the plugin, or modifications to the manifest, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
runtime moves to a model where plugins are deployed and run from as
unexploded jar files, then we can probably use a single signature for
the whole thing.&nbsp; However, in the current model, we would need a
manifest of signatures that confirms the source and the unmodified state
of each file in the plugin.</LI>
  <LI> Will probably need new CodeSource and ClassLoader classes.</LI>
  <LI>Need new Policy format and implementation. &nbsp;The default
policy implementation uses a permissions format that is insufficiently
expressive for what we want to do.&nbsp; Would probably use an XML based
format (XACML?).&nbsp; The Policy class implementation also needs to
support dynamic changes during runtime</LI>
  <LI>Will need to add doPrivileged() blocks to critical code in the
platform . &nbsp;Basically, when Permissions are insufficiently
expressive such that code needs to figure out dynamically based on
context whether an operation should be carried out, a 'doPrivileged'
section needs to be introduced in the code. &nbsp;For example consider
the following call stack:<BR>
    <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">platform.Code.criticalMethod()&nbsp;
-&gt; performs critical operation<BR>
platform.Code.someMethod() -&gt; calls criticalMethod()<BR>
unknown.Code.otherMethod() -&gt; calls someMethod()<BR>
    <BR>
    </DIV>
If there is a sufficiently expressive Permission object that could
apply to this call stack in all scenarios, (i.e. no matter what the
context, the permission defines whether "unknown.Code.otherMethod()" is
allowed to do the critical operation) then we do not need a doPrivileged
block. An example of that might be using a FilePermission to protect a
specific file.  I.E. if critical method is going to access a specific
File (or directory) and we know that in ALL circumstances we want
unknown.Code.otherMethod() to only have 'read' permission on that file
then we don't need a doPrivileged block inside criticalMethod. We would
simply grant the permission to read the particular file.  Note that a
Permission that granted permission to read ALL files would not be
expressive enough here because it would be more permissive than we want.<BR>
If, on the other hand, whether we allow the "unknown.Code.otherMethod"
to perform the operation is determined by contextual information
unavailable when the Permission is defined (we didn't know the path to
the file), or simply of a nature that can't be expressed by the
Permission (for example, we want to provide access to parts of a file
but not other parts, and perhaps only if other context metadata is
satisfied such as who the current 'user' is, then in that case, we need
to do two things to the 'criticalMethod()' code.&nbsp; 1) we need to put
a doPrivileged section in it to stop the security checks from going
further down the stack and 2) we need to actually codify the logic to
figure out programmatically whether the operation should be performed or
not.</LI>
  <LI>Need a new SecurityManager implementation. &nbsp;The
checkPermission() method is where we need to trap unpermitted actions
and handle them in a user-friendly way such as by asking the user if
he/she wants to allow the action once, or allow the action always or
deny it, whatever. &nbsp;In a GUI application, this means putting up
appropriate wizard panels to prompt the user. &nbsp;For a headless
application, it may mean prompting at stdin or simpy logging/reporting
failure if non-interactive mode.</LI>
  <LI>Need a keystore to protect each user's local data with
encryption. &nbsp;Q: Can we use the default keystore provided with Java?</LI>
  <LI>Need mechanism for administrative provisioning of application
configuration. &nbsp;This requires a secure 'remote control' feature for
the client. &nbsp;This may be beyond the scope of the Eclipse platform
in particular, but we want to make sure we do nothing to preclude such a
feature in specific applications developed on the platform.
&nbsp;Provisioning mechanisms may be provided by use of an OSGi
framework as platform runtime.&nbsp; However, useful GUI's will need to
be developed appropriate for RCP and Eclipse use cases.&nbsp; Not
certain yet if framework API's are sufficient for all use cases.</LI>
  <LI>In all cases, we should try to design code such that it is
possible to run without security features and in that case be as
backward compatible as possible. &nbsp;This is not necessarily a matter
of just turning the security model off. &nbsp;In addition to Java
Security API-specific changes needed to make the platform secure, it may
also be necessary to make API changes in the current code in order to
secure code within Java Language Access Protection rules (otherwise you
may be insecure even if you are running with a security manager). Such
API changes may mean that even if you have the security manager
disabled, &nbsp;that you may not be backward compatible for some code.<BR>
  </LI>
</UL>
<BR>
<SPAN style="font-weight: bold;"> Performance ramifications of adding
security to the platform:</SPAN><BR>
<UL>
  <LI> It is expected that running the platform with a security manager
enabled will cause a performance hit during runtime.&nbsp; This impact
may be ameliaroated by code that does not directly or indirectly invoke
a privileged action (thus triggering a security stack crawl), however
that does not seem likely for the bulk of really useful code.</LI>
  <LI> the platform could run without a security manager enabled and
most of this hit should go away.&nbsp; However, 'doPrivileged()'
sections of code may still have an impact, depending on how well
designed they are.</LI>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom gave updates on Equinox Summit: P2 security and login were big interest. Trusted bundles (ie: load-time) seemed to go over well as a looser grained authorization solution</li>
<li>Talked at length about potential consumers of login, including newcomers like R.A.P. (RCP server side). Need to decide on a login integration point</li>
<li>Matt talked about completion of security M2. Provider plumbing is mostly in place, some configuration UI, all code is Equinox code-style compliant</li>
<li>Oleg gave Equinox Summit updates: saw interest in JAAS, roles, load-time (trusted bundles)</li>
<li>Discussed role-based authorization decisions based on JAAS</li> 
</ul>

<p><strong>Actions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt to start discussion on p2 security model going forward on equinox-dev</li>
<li>Tom to look over some of the security API, eye towards non-typical Lotus scenarios like server-side (use of statics, etc)</li>
<li>Eric and Jay are working on API and UI for code security based alerts, will get with Tom to discuss .provisional jarverifier code</li>
<li>Matt and Oleg to go over security function, agree on exposed API</li>
<li>Ted working on JRE-agnostic scanning results</li>
</ul>

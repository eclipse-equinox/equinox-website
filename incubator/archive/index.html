<p class=bar>Archived material</p>
<p>The Equinox incubator has evolved from its original investigation into runtime
  alternatives through various other work areas. As work areas are promoted to
  the production codebase or abandoned, their work material, documents and web
  site content are archived here. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Phase 1 - <a href="phase1content.zip">content</a> and <a href="phase1repo.tgz">repo
    tar.</a> Phase 1 of Equinox was the orirginal runtime and dynamic plug-in
    work. After Eclipse 3.0 shipped, Phase 1 was terminated and Phase 2 started.
    These archives include
    both the resource history (i.e., a tar of the content in the repo) and a
    snapshot of the content at the time of archiving (i.e., a zip of the contents
  of HEAD).</li>
  <li><a href="dynamicPlugins">Dynamic plug-ins</a> - This work carried on into
    Phase 2 but was largely incorporated in Eclipse 3.1.</li>
</ul>

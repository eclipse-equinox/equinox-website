  <p><b>Summary</b> <br>
  The Eclipse team currently changes their plug-in version numbers to match each
    major release of Eclipse (e.g., 2.1, 3.0). This is a convenient
    way of understanding the origin of plug-ins but does not capture the actual
    semantics of the changes that occurred. Here we outline the current use of version numbers
    and propose guidelines for using plug-in
    version numbering to better indicate levels of compatibility.</p>

<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
<p>Current Eclipse practice calls for the teams to increment plug-in version
  numbers to match the upcoming release of Eclipse. For example, during the eclipse 3.1 development
cycle, our plug-in version numbers went from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0, such that when we  
  delivered Eclipse 3.1 all plug-ins (save a few third party ones) were versioned as 
3.1.0. This is convenient because it allows people to look at the plug-in version
number and immediately understand what version of Eclipse that plug-in is from.</p>
<p>This approach has several drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The arbitrary change of a version number creates artificial incompatibilities for 
plug-ins properly expressing their prerequisites.
For example, in eclipse 3.0, even though org.eclipse.core.resources only received minor bug fixes, 
its version has been set to 3.0.0 thus unnecessarily forcing people relying on the version 2.1.0
to release a new version of their plug-in.</li>

  <li>This approach does not set a good example. People building on top of
      Eclipse look to us to understand how they should structure their work.
    If the community followed the eclipse way and changed the version number on each release, 
    plug-ins like EMF and GEF would have incremented their version numbers to match the 
    Eclipse version numbers regardless of whether they had changed
    at all. In addition to causing the problem outlined in the previous point, it also does not 
    scale well as a small change at the bottom 
    ripples all the way up.</li>

   <li>Because plug-in versions are not incremented on a per build basis, the update
    manager can not be used to deliver plug-ins and thus is not exercised by the development team.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>The following proposal is twofold:
<ul>
  <li>first it provides guidelines on how plug-in versions should be used</li>
  <li>second it provides guidelines on how feature versions should be used as well as proposes some improvements to the feature mechanism</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Guidelines on versioning plug-ins</h3>
<p>This section contains a set of guidelines expressing how to evolve plug-in version numbers in a way that captures the nature
of the changes that have been made. </p>
<p>
Reminder: in eclipse, version numbers are composed of four (4) segments: 3 integers and a string respectively named major.minor.service.qualifier.
</p>
Each segment captures a different intent:
	<ul>
	<li> the major segment indicates breakage in the API </li>
	<li> the minor segment indicates "externally visible" changes</li>
	<li> the service segment indicates bug fixes and the change of development stream (the semantics attached to development stream is new to this proposal, see below)</li>
	<li> the qualifier segment indicates a particular build</li>    
	</ul>

	
<h4>When to change the major segment</h4>
<p>The major segment number should be increased when a plug-in changes in a non binary compatible way. When the major segment is changed
the minor and service segments are reset to 0.<br/>
<b>Example</b>: From the version 2.2.7, an incompatible change would lead to 3.0.0.<br/>
By definition, such changes should not be made when working in a maintenance stream.</p>

<h4>When to change the minor segment</h4>
The minor segment number should be incremented when a plug-in changes in an "externally visible" way. Examples of externally visible
changes include binary compatible API changes, significant performance changes, major code rework, etc. Another way to know when this version number 
should be changed is by exclusion: it should indicate changes that are neither bug fixes (indicated by the service segment) 
nor breaking API changes (indicated by the major segment). When the minor segment is changed, the service segment 
is reset to 0.<br/>
<b>Example</b>: From the version 2.2.7, a minor change would lead to 2.3.0.<br/>
Such changes would not typically be made when working in a maintenance stream.<br/>


<h4>When to change the service segment</h4>
The service segment number should be changed to indicate that bug fixes have occurred in a plug-in. <br>
What is new in this proposal is that in addition, incrementing the version number by one hundred (100) indicates the changes of developement stream.
This increment must be done when the first bug fix is done in a new development stream.
This practice makes it easy to manage one line of 
descent after a release and still guarantee that plug-ins coming in 
the next release will have a higher version number than ones from 
maintenance releases (thus enabling the usage of update manager from maintenance 
releases to the new releases).<br/>
<b>Example</b>: At the end of the development stream N, the version of the plug-in P is 2.4.8. When P receives its first bug fix in the development
stream N+1 or higher, then the version should be changed to 2.4.108. If P version 2.4.8 needs to receive a bug fix in the maintenance stream started
from N, then its version number will be 2.4.9.
</p>

<h4>Overall example</h4>
This example shows how the version of a plug-in reacts to changes (indicated in parenthesis) in the context of different development stream.
Both the text and the diagram illustrate the same example.
<pre>
First development stream
 - 1.0.0

Second development stream
 - 1.0.100 (indicates a bug fix)
 - 1.1.0 (a new API has been introduced)
 The plug-in ships as 1.1.0

Third development stream
 - 1.1.100 (indicates a bug fix)
 - 2.0.0 (indicates a breaking change)
 The plug-in ships as 2.0.0

Maintenance stream after 1.1.0
 - 1.1.1
 The plug-in ships as 1.1.1

<h4> When to change the qualifier segment</h4>
<p>Because changing the version number of a plug-in on every commit can be burdensome to the development team, we recommend only applying the previous 
guidelines once per release cycle. However, since we want to enable the use of the update manager by the development teams, we will use the qualifier 
segment to indicate changes between builds.</p>

<p>Since Eclipse 3.1, PDE Build can automatically derive the value of the qualifier from the tag associated with the plug-in
in the map file that has been fed as input to the build. This leaves the responsibility to the developer preparing the input for the build 
to tag their plug-ins with a value that is lexicographically higher than the previous one. To facilitate this, we recommend the usage of the 
date formatted as YearMonthDay or a number that you increment everytime.<br/> 
<b>Example</b>: The map file for the plug-in P indicates v20050506, and P's version is 4.2.3. The resulting fully qualified version number would be
4.2.3.v20050506.<br/>
Deriving the qualifier from the build input offers the advantage that if the plug-in code has not changed, no new version will be created
and therefore update manager won't download the plug-in again.</p>



<h4>How to specify plug-in requirements</h4>
<p>Plug-ins that require other plug-ins must qualify their requirements with a version range since the absence of a version range means that any version 
can satisfy the dependency. Given that all the changes between the version x.0.0 and the version x+1.0.0 excluded must be compatible 
(given the previous guidelines); the recommended range includes the minimal required version up-to but not including the next major release.<br/>
<b>Example</b> JFace 3.1.0 should probably express the following requirement on SWT: [3.1.0, 4.0.0).</p>

<p>Also, while setting values for prerequisites, watch for opportunities to widen the set of plug-ins against which a plug-in can work.<br/>
<b>Example</b>: A plug-in using basic functions from the job API, may express a dependency on runtime 3.0.0 ( [3.0.0, 4.0.0) ) instead of 3.1.0 ( [3.1.0, 4.0.0) ).
</p>


<h4>How to specify versions when plug-ins re-export other plug-ins</h4>
<p>Plug-ins re-exporting other plug-ins tie themselves to the re-exported plug-ins, since they are making the re-exported plug-ins part of their API.
Therefore, the version of such plug-ins must indicate the most significant type of change between all the plug-ins they re-export and the changes made locally.
<br/>
<b>Example</b>: JFace 8.4.2 re-exports SWT 1.1.1 and Commands 2.2.2.<br/>
Case 1: if Commands increases its service segment to 2.2.3, JFace version does not need to change.<br/>
Case 2: if Commands increases its service segment to 2.2.3, and SWT its minor segment to 1.2.0, JFace version would be 8.5.0.<br/>
Case 3: if JFace makes incompatible changes, JFace would change to 9.0.0 covering changes from re-exported plug-ins.<br/>
</p>

<h4>How to version packages</h4>
<p>Exported packages being used as service APIs must have a version number. The guidelines to evolve those version numbers are the same as for plug-ins. 
For plug-ins importing individual packages, you should follow the same guidelines as when requiring a plug-in to specify the version range of packages being imported.</p>

<h4>Which version to use in javadoc tags</h4>
<p>In the javadoc, @since tags are used to indicate the version of a <b>plug-in</b> in which a specific API has been added. Because javadoc
describes API, only the first two segment of the plug-in version number should be used. This represents a change
with the current practice where @since indicates the development stream. In addition to using the plug-in version, we recommend to prefix
the version number by the plug-in id. This allows to track APIs moving from a plug-in to another (this can happen when a plug-in is split
into multiple plug-ins but the package names are kept).<br/>
<b>Example</b>: In the 3.2 development stream, the API of the new plug-in org.eclipse.core.filesystem should be tagged as follows:<br/>
/**<br/>
 * This class is the main entry point for clients of the Eclipse file system API.  This<br/>
 * class has factory methods for obtaining instances of file systems and file<br/>
 * stores, and provides constants for option values and error codes.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * This class is not intended to be instantiated or subclassed.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <b>@since org.eclipse.core.filesytem 1.0</b><br/>
 */<br/>
</p>

<h3>Versioning features</h3>
<p>Features are a grouping mechanism that supports reasoning in terms of sets of plug-ins. Therefore, features hide the plug-in boundaries 
of the plug-ins they contain
and act as if their API was the set of all the APIs of all the consituting plug-ins.
Because of this, features are akin to plug-ins re-exporting other plug-ins and should follow the same versioning guidelines.
</p>
<p>To avoid the brittleness caused by version changes in required features, we recommend feature authors favor the expression
of their dependencies at the plug-in level, rather than at the feature level. To be more precise, all the immediate plug-ins required by 
the plug-ins included in a feature should be listed as plug-in prerequisite of the feature. This approach has the benefit of isolating feature
authors from changes that do not impact them.</p>
<b>Example</b> 
<pre>
 Case 1: Today the feature org.eclipse.gef is as follows:
    requires feature org.eclipse.platform	3.1.0
    contains plugins:
      org.eclipse.draw2d	3.1.0
      org.eclipse.gef		3.1.0
 
 Case 2: In the new model it should be:
     requires feature org.eclipse.platform	3.1.0
     contains plugins:
       org.eclipse.draw2d	3.1.0
       org.eclipse.gef		3.1.0  
     requires plugins:
       org.eclipse.core.runtime [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
       org.eclipse.ui.views     [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
       org.eclipse.ui.workbench [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
       org.eclipse.jface        [3.1.0, 4.0.0)
       org.eclipse.swt		[3.1.0, 4.0.0)

</pre>
In case 1, if the version of the org.eclipse.platform feature changes to 4.0.0 (because org.eclipse.core.resources changes
its major version number), org.eclipse.gef is required to deliver a new version of its features. In case 2, such changes are transparent
to the author of gef.
<p/>


<h3>"Warm fuzzy" feeling</h3>
<p>When version numbers are evolving all at once, looking at the feature version is enough to understand which eclipse build is
being run (1). However, this is no longer possible because versions evolve independently. To address this problem we are proposing
the introduction of a so called "marketing" string that will 
be used to show a more "meaningful to the end user" number (for example the name of the "eclipse train", see bug #108146). 
It is important to note that no semantics can be attached to this string nor can it be used to express dependency among features.
<br/>

<b>Example</b>: The version number of the platform feature could be 3.1.7.v20051010 allowing the precise capture of dependencies among
features, and the marketing string could be still be 3.1 or even "Zebra".
<br/>
(1) This has never been completly true as some plugins do not have matching numbers (e.g., lucene, tomcat, junit...),
and no warmth is generated regarding additions or deletions of plugins or features.
</p>


<h2>Transitioning</h2>
<p>If we decide to follow these new guidances, we can retrofit the 3.2
  plug-ins with &quot;correct&quot; version numbers. 
  Starting now avoids the situation where Eclipse 3.1 based plug-ins do not
  work on the released 3.2 because of resolution problems (rather than because
  of actual incompatibilities).</p>

This effort needs to be coordinated inside each deliverable (one deliverable being SDK, or GEF, or EMF...) by a person
that will be responsible for telling each plug-in owner when to change their version numbers.
<p>
<b>Updating the plug-ins</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Wait until all the plug-ins you rely on have their correct version number.</li>
<li>Set your version number correctly using the guidelines previously described, review your code change since the beginning of the 3.2 development 
cycle and decide if your version number should be 3.1.x+100 or 3.2.0. Be careful to not forget about the re-exported plug-ins.</li>
<li>Suffix the version number of your plug-in by ".qualifier" (e.g.., 3.1.100.qualifier) to enable the qualifier generation by PDE Build</li>
<li>Set your prerequisite correctly using the guidelines previously described.</li>
</ol>
<p>

<b>Updating feature version number</b>
<ol>
<li>The feature version number can be modified once all the plug-ins included in the feature and all the features included in that feature have been modified. 
This is a manual step and could eventually be tooled (see bug #111543)</li>
<li>The list of required plug-ins will be computed automatically based on the set of plug-ins included in the feature (see bug #111541).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<h3>One branch of descent</h3>
The solution proposed for changing the service segment after a release makes the management of multiple lines of descent hard to deal 
with (but not impossible -- to work around this, one may decide to increment the qualifier by more than 100 if they know that there will 
be multiple lines of descent). 
Having looked at how plug-ins evolve in the eclipse eco-systems we believe this restriction is not likely to cause problems for us.

<h3>Generation of qualifiers</h3>
<p>For teams not using a map file-like mechanism, PDE build will generate a value derived from the date and time of day. Doing this is, however, not recommended since 
even plug-ins whose code has not been changed yet will be given a new qualifier causing update to unnecessarily download the binary.
</p>
<p>For teams having a mechanism other than map files, the build can be provided with a file where the value of qualifier will be read.</p>


<h3>Features semantics</h3>
These recommendations represent a shift in the way features are being used, and will require
some adaptations in the syntax and in the code (see list below). In fact, this proposal acknowledges the fact that plug-ins are 
the only things that matter.
<p>
Here is an outline of the changes that would be required:
<ul>
<li>Enhancement of the feature syntax to support a marketing string.</li>
<li>The usage of "required feature" is changed, such that requirements on features do not have to be satisfied as long 
as the plug-ins that are required by a feature are present.<br/>
<b>Example</b>: In the GEF example, if runtime, views, workbench, jface and swt are present, then the gef feature can be installed.
</li>

<li>The expression of required features becomes a hint for the update manager to know where to get missing plug-ins if they are not present.<br/>
<b>Example</b>: In the GEF example, if any of runtime, views, workbench, jface or swt is not present, update manager should go 
and download the complete 3.1.0 platform feature or higher.</li>

<li>The expression of required plug-ins must be enhanced to support version ranges</li>
</ul>
Note that these enhancements are not required to move forward with this proposal.
